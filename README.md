The purpose of this programming assignment is to solve a simple puzzle using logical language Prolog. List manipulation by defining predicates 

The following puzzle was solved using List manipulation and defining multiple predicates: 

A farmer must ferry a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage across a river using a boat that is too small to take more than one of the three across at once. If he leaves the wolf and the goat together, the wolf will eat the goat, and if he leaves the goat with the cabbage, the goat will eat the cabbage. How can he get all three across the river safely?
